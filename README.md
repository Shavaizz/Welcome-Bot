# Welcome-Bot
A simple welcome bot that also replies to certain messages
It has verify and purge features, also has some commands for "fun" such as jokes etc.
This is only a starting point for a simple bot without any OOP or other systems implemented

Currently there is a basic text and syntax added which can be changed once you clone this onto your server/machine. Change those inputs to personalize the bot to your own taste
